Plan of attack for updating AQLite
1. Teamview into EPA's laptop.
2. Install DFU and CLI on laptop from (link sent by Austin).
3. Install teraterm on laptop.
4. Flash PAM in AQLite with newest firmware (OS version 2.1.0)
	a. Austin will have this on his computer
5. This "should" start uploading and we can test adjusting values through the particle dashboard.
6. If this doesn't work, troubleshoot!

*** Troubleshooting
1. Could be the i2c for the RH/Temp sensor - disable the HIH8120 sensor it with 'T'.
2. 



Plan of attack for AQSync:
1. Have the EPA person plug usb drive into the computer that we are teamviewed into.
2. Copy the following files to hus drive:
   a) Generic2BTouch_pi3
   b) Generic2BTouch_pi4
   c) Scripts.tar
3. Have epa person plug usb drive into the AQSync (top slot)
4. Update Scripts
5. Update Generic2BTouch

Update scripts:
1. Walk epa person through accessingAQSyncViaKeyboard.txt
   a) Make sure they start on the MainWindow (starting page)
2. Once the epa person has connected, update the Scripts
   a) Copy the update archive from the usb 'mv /media/usb/Scripts.tar /home/pi/'
   b) Move the current version to act as a backup 'mv /home/pi/Scripts /home/pi/Scripts_old'
   c) Extra the new Scripts from the archive 'tar -xvf Scripts.tar'
   d) If successful, clean up files 'rm -f /homepi/Scripts.tar && rm -rf /home/pi/Scripts_old'
      If unsuccessful, place backup 'mv /home/pi/Scripts_old /home/pi/Scripts'
   e) Save changes 'sync'
3. Restart device 'sudo reboot'

Update Generic2BTouch
1. After inserting usb (top slot), have epa person power cycle device
2. Wait for all restarts to stop (wait 1-2 mins)
3. Have epa person attempt to change wi-fi
   a) Depending upon the strength of the wi-fi and how many devices are connected, this step can take upto 5 mins to work after the blocking label closes
